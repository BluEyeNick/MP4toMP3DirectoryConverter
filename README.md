# Video to MP3 Converter

This is a simple Python script that converts video files in a specified directory to MP3 audio files using the `moviepy` library.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the `moviepy` library. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
pip install moviepy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Modify the `input_directory` and `output_directory` variables in the script to point to your desired input and output directories.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

Please make sure you have all the necessary permissions to access the input directory and create files in the output directory.

## Example

Suppose you want to convert video files from the directory `C:\Music\example` to MP3 files and save them in `C:\Music\example\output`. You would set the `input_directory` and `output_directory` variables like this:

```python
input_directory = r"C:\Music\example"
output_directory = r"C:\Music\example\output"
```

Then run the script using a Python interpreter. It will convert each video file in the input directory to an MP3 file in the output directory.
